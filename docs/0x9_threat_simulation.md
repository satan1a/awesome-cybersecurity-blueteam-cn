# Threat Simulation

A curated list of awesome adversary simulation resources

## Tools

- [MITRE CALDERA](https://github.com/mitre/caldera) - An automated adversary emulation system that performs post-compromise adversarial behavior within Windows Enterprise networks.
- [APTSimulator](https://github.com/NextronSystems/APTSimulator) - A Windows Batch script that uses a set of tools and output files to make a system look as if it was compromised.
- [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) - Small and highly portable detection tests mapped to the Mitre ATT&CK Framework.
- [Network Flight Simulator](https://github.com/alphasoc/flightsim) - flightsim is a lightweight utility used to generate malicious network traffic and help security teams to evaluate security controls and network visibility.
- [Metta](https://github.com/uber-common/metta) - A security preparedness tool to do adversarial simulation.
- [Red Team Automation (RTA)](https://github.com/endgameinc/RTA) - RTA provides a framework of scripts designed to allow blue teams to test their detection capabilities against malicious tradecraft, modeled after MITRE ATT&CK.
- [SharpShooter](https://github.com/mdsecactivebreach/SharpShooter) - Payload Generation Framework.
- [CACTUSTORCH](https://github.com/mdsecactivebreach/CACTUSTORCH) - Payload Generation for Adversary Simulations.
- [DumpsterFire](https://github.com/TryCatchHCF/DumpsterFire) - A modular, menu-driven, cross-platform tool for building repeatable, time-delayed, distributed security events.
- [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire)([website](http://www.powershellempire.com)) - A PowerShell and Python post-exploitation agent.
- [PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/) - A PowerShell Post-Exploitation Framework.
- [RedHunt-OS](https://github.com/redhuntlabs/RedHunt-OS) - A Virtual Machine for Adversary Emulation and Threat Hunting. RedHunt aims to be a one stop shop for all your threat emulation and threat hunting needs by integrating attacker's arsenal as well as defender's toolkit to actively identify the threats in your environment.
- [Infection Monkey](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey) - An open source Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tool that assesses the resiliency of private and public cloud environments to post-breach attacks and lateral movement.
- [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range) - A tool that allows you to create vulnerable instrumented local or cloud environments to simulate attacks against and collect the data into Splunk.
